# soliton-implementation
Implementation of the soliton model 

## Praktikum
- [ ] Visualisation
  - [ ] Find proper framework(s)
  - [ ] Visualize soliton graphs
- [ ] Check for validity of soliton graphs
- [ ] Simulation/ Animation
  - [ ]  Find way to animate a soliton traversing the molecule
  - [ ]  Let soliton make a valid soliton path
    - [ ]  Make soliton choose every possible edge at each node in some case
    - [ ]  Let soliton change every bond it traverses
  - [ ]  Implement possibility to skip step by step animation and show result immediately
- [ ] Build application 
- [ ] Allow user to define input molecule 

## Bachelorarbeit
- [ ] Extend implementation to multiple solitons
