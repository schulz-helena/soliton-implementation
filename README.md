# soliton-implementation
Implementation of the soliton model 

## Praktikum
- [x] Visualisation
  - [x] Find proper framework(s)
  - [x] Visualize soliton graphs
- [x] Check for validity of soliton graphs
- [x] Animation
  - [x]  Find way to animate a soliton traversing the molecule
- [x] Computation of soliton paths
    - [x]  Make soliton choose every possible edge at each node in some case
    - [x]  Let soliton change every bond it traverses
- [ ] Write software 
  - [x] Allow user to define input molecule
  - [X] Write a GUI
  - [x] Implement possibility to skip step by step animation and show result immediately
  - [ ] Build application

## Bachelorarbeit
